# Sonic Push

Sonic Pi scripts to use Ableton Push in a DAWless workflow. Using SCM to track changes. Using GitHub to share.

# Sonic Pi Compatibility

All the features necessary to run Sonic Push should be available in Sonic Pi v3.2. I've had [issues using
x3.2-beta with OSX](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/issues/2101) and therefore am running a custom version
of v3.1 with some features ported from v3.2. Patches for this custom version are available in sonic-pi-patches.

# Apologies

I would like to formally apologize for this code. What seemed like a good idea has gone well out of hand.
There be dragons and spaghetti everywhere.
